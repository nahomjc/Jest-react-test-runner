## Introduction

This project focuses on testing user feedback input and range fields from a form. If the user gives a score of 4 on a scale of 1 to 10, they will be asked why they are not satisfied with our product. We are using Jest and React Test Runner to check these activities. üß™üë®‚Äçüíª

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FeedBackForm.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd FeedBackForm
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

The `FeedBackForm` component is a form that allows users to submit feedback by setting a score and providing a comment. The component uses React's `useState` hook to manage its local state, and it calls a function passed in via props whenever the form is submitted.

## Tests

This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
